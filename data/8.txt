New York: Spending too much time with mobile phones can harm your health, a new research has revealed.The study conducted by Kent State University found that students, who spent lot of time on their phone- up to 14 hours each day- were less fit than those spending about 1 and a half hour a day, New York Daily News reported.The report also said that people, who spent more time on their mobile devices, were more likely to engage in other sedentary forms of entertainment, like playing video games or watching films.The authors wrote that the possibility that cell phone use could encourage physical activity among people who use it heavily while disrupting physical activity and encouraging sedentary activity among high-frequency users may help explain the significant negative relationship between cell phone use and cardiorespiratory fitness identified in the study.The study has been published online in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity.

Bharti Airtel gained 3.62%. Bharti Airtel said during market hours today, 11 July 2013, that it is shocked and disappointed to receive a demand notice of Rs 650 crore from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) pertaining to the service of Subscriber Local Dialing (SLD) to its subscribers between 2002 and 2005. Bharti Airtel believes that the demand for penalty of Rs 650 crore is devoid of any merit and has no justification both on facts and in law. Bharti Airtel had in 2002 launched the SLD service and had fully satisfied the sector regulator on this service and its various aspects. The regulator had found this service to be customer friendly and in compliance of the licence conditions. The total revenue this SLD service generated for Bharti Airtel was a few lacs of rupees, a fact which is fully known to the DoT. Yet strangely, without as much as giving us a proper hearing, the DoT has after 8 years has issued a demand notice of Rs 650 crore in complete disregard of the natural process of justice.
The company said it is disappointed that the DoT which has the bounden duty to act rationally, has thought it fit to issue such a baseless penalty order, leaving the company with no choice, but to litigate. The company wishes the DoT was mindful of the damage such meritless demands have on investor sentiment and the frustration such actions cause to the companies engaged in vital infrastructure. The company has urged the DoT to set out a cogent policy on imposition of penalties so that the telecom companies can operate in a rational and transparent environment.
